## Limitations 
AFINN as a form of sentiment analysis is rudimentary and prone to errors. 

It is not able to recognise entities or phrases and as it does not account for nuances in natural language. For instance, "Korea Exports **_Dent Optimism_** Over Global Tech Demand Recovery" is clearly negative in sentiment but would compute a positive AFINN score of 2 as the negation is not detected. 

A more sophisticated natural language processesing API would have been preferred. There are many available (e.g. Google Cloud Natural Language API, Turbo NLP API, Microsoft Azure Text Analytics). However, these require Node.js. 


## Extensions
+ sentiment tag cloud - words with font sizes varying according to frequency in latest headlines
+ sentiment words scatter diagram - with y-axis: (AFINN-score) || x-axis: frequency in latest headlines
